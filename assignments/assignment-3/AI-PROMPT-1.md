Please create a simple CSS file for my portfolio website inspired by [INSPIRATION SOURCE] look and feel. I'm a student learning CSS basics and need styling for the following sections:

- Navigation bar
- Header/intro section
- About me section
- Education section
- Projects section
- Contact form
- Footer

I'd like my website to have the colors, style, and mood that remind people of [INSPIRATION SOURCE]. Make sure the layout is responsive for mobile and desktop screens. Please add helpful comments that explain what different parts of the CSS do.

Some specific things I'd like:
- A color scheme based on [INSPIRATION SOURCE]
- Easy-to-read fonts
- Some simple hover effects on buttons and links
- Basic responsive design (works on mobile and desktop)
- Reasonable spacing between elements

See sample index.hmtl below.

Thank you!
