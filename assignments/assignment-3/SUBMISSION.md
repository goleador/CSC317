## Analysis
This assignment challenged me to create four different CSS approaches for the same portfolio HTML. I found that each method had distinct advantages: hand-written CSS offered the most control, AI-generated CSS provided creative ideas I wouldn't have thought of, and the hybrid approach combined the best of both worlds.

The hand-written CSS was initially the most time-consuming but resulted in cleaner code. The AI approaches generated comprehensive styling quickly but often needed refinement for accessibility and performance optimization. The hybrid solution allowed me to leverage AI's creativity while applying my design sensibilities and optimization knowledge.

Each approach produced noticeably different visual results despite styling the same content. This demonstrated how powerful CSS can be in transforming a website's look and feel without changing the HTML structure.

## Preferred Version
I prefer the hybrid solution because it combines the best aspects of each approach. It maintains the clean, efficient structure of my hand-written code while incorporating the visual polish and creative interactions from the AI-generated styles. The hybrid version also performed best in browser testing and had the most balanced file size to feature ratio.
