# AI CSS with Image Prompt Template

This guide will help you create an effective prompt for generating your `ai-2.css` file using both an image and text description.

## Basic Template

```
I'm looking to create a CSS file for my portfolio website inspired by this image. I'd like to incorporate elements from the image such as its colors, textures, and overall mood into my site design.

[Insert your image here]

Please generate a CSS file that:

1. Uses the color palette extracted from this image
2. Incorporates the image (or elements from it) as:
   - A hero section background
   - A text mask for headings
   - Section dividers or accents
   - Pattern or texture elements

My portfolio includes these sections:
- Navigation bar
- Header/intro section
- About me section
- Education section
- Projects section
- Contact form
- Footer

Please create responsive styling that works on both mobile and desktop. Include helpful comments explaining what different parts of the CSS do.

Additional styling requests:
- Use modern CSS techniques
- Create smooth transitions between sections
- Make interactive elements (buttons, links) feel cohesive with the image style
- Balance readability with creative design elements

Thank you!
```

## What Images Work Best

For the best results, choose images that have:

1. **Clear, distinct color palettes** - Images with 3-5 prominent colors work well for creating a cohesive scheme
2. **Interesting textures or patterns** - These can be used as backgrounds or accents
3. **Good contrast** - Ensures text remains readable when colors are extracted
4. **Relevant themes** - Images that somehow relate to your personal brand or career field
5. **Clean composition** - Not too busy or cluttered, with defined areas that could be extracted

## Image Types to Consider

### Landscapes

## Example Ideas

1. **Nature-Inspired Portfolio**
    - Use a misty mountain landscape
    - Extract cool blues and greens for the color scheme
    - Incorporate subtle fog/mist effects on hover
    - Use mountain silhouettes as section dividers

2. **Tech-Focused Design**
    - Choose a close-up of a circuit board or tech texture
    - Extract blues, blacks, and accent colors
    - Use circuit patterns as subtle backgrounds
    - Create "digital" transitions between sections

3. **Artistic Portfolio**
    - Select a watercolor or abstract painting
    - Pull the vibrant colors for your scheme
    - Use paint texture elements throughout the design
    - Create text masks with artistic brush strokes

4. **Minimalist Approach**
    - Choose a simple geometric abstract image
    - Extract a limited, cohesive color palette
    - Use clean lines and shapes inspired by the image
    - Create subtle animations based on the geometry

## Tips for Success

1. **Provide context** - Tell the AI how you want the image elements to be used
2. **Be specific** - Mention particular aspects of the image you like
3. **Consider usability** - Ask for a balance between creative design and readability
4. **Ask for explanations** - Request comments in the CSS to help you understand the technique
5. **Link to the image** - If you can't embed it, provide a public link where the AI can access it

Remember to save both your prompt and a reference to your inspiration image in a comment at the top of your `ai-2.css` file!
