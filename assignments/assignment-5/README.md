## Directory Structure

Your project must follow this directory structure:

    ├── app.js
    ├── package.json
    ├── public/
    │   ├── css/
    │   ├── js/
    │   └── images/

    ├── utils/
    └── README.md
```

## Grading Criteria

Your project will be evaluated on:

1. **Functionality (40%)**
   - All features work as described
   - No major bugs or errors
   - Proper error handling

2. **Code Quality (25%)**
