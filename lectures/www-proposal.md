# WWW Proposal



When **Tim Berners-Lee** proposed the **World Wide Web** at CERN (in 1989, with a refined proposal in 1990), he wasn’t inventing the Internet itself (that already existed), but proposing a **system to organize and share information across it**.

Here’s what he proposed:

------

### Core Idea

- A **global hypertext system**: documents linked together via “hyperlinks,” allowing scientists at CERN (and eventually anywhere) to navigate from one piece of information to another seamlessly.

### Key Components

1. **Uniform Resource Identifier (URI):** A standard way to locate and identify documents and resources.
2. **Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP):** A simple protocol for requesting and serving documents.
3. **Hypertext Markup Language (HTML):** A lightweight markup language to format documents with links, images, and text.
4. **A Web Browser & Editor:** A program to view and create linked documents.
5. **A Web Server:** A system to store and provide documents when requested.

### Vision

- To make it easy for **physicists and researchers at CERN** to share documents, research papers, and data without emailing files around or dealing with incompatible systems.
- To create a **“web” of information** rather than isolated silos — information could be browsed by following links, not just by searching filenames.

### Famous Line

In his original 1989 memo, he described it simply as:

> “a large hypertext database with typed links.”

------

So, Berners-Lee’s proposal was essentially the blueprint of the **modern web stack (URL, HTTP, HTML)**, designed to **turn the Internet into a web of linked knowledge**.

👉 Do you want me to show you a snippet of **what his original proposal diagram looked like** (nodes and links forming a web), or would you prefer I rewrite it in simple modern terms (like “Google Docs meets hyperlinks”)?
