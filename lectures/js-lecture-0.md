# JavaScript History, Role, and Development Environment
## CSC317 - Week 0

---

## 1. Introduction to JavaScript

### Brief History
- Created by Brendan Eich in just 10 days in 1995 while at Netscape
- Originally named "Mocha," then "LiveScript," finally "JavaScript"
- Named to capitalize on the popularity of Java, despite being unrelated
- Designed as a lightweight scripting language for web browsers

### Evolution of JavaScript
- 1997: Standardized as ECMAScript (ECMA-262)
- 2005: AJAX revolutionizes web applications
- 2009: Node.js brings JavaScript to the server-side
- 2015: ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) introduces major enhancements
- Present: Annual releases with new features

### JavaScript vs. ECMAScript
- ECMAScript: The official specification
- JavaScript: The implementation of the ECMAScript standard
- Other implementations: JScript (Microsoft), ActionScript (Adobe)

### Modern JavaScript (ES6+) Features
- Arrow functions
- Template literals
- Destructuring
- Promises and async/await
- Classes
- Modules
- Let and const declarations
- Spread/rest operators

## 2. The Role of JavaScript in Web Development

### Client-Side Applications
- DOM manipulation and dynamic HTML
- Event handling
- Form validation
- Animation and visual effects
- Single Page Applications (SPAs)

### Server-Side Development with Node.js
- HTTP servers
- RESTful APIs
- Middleware
- Backend business logic
- Database interactions

### Full-Stack JavaScript Development
- Same language across the stack
- JSON as native data format
- Shared code between client and server
- Unified developer experience

### JavaScript Frameworks and Libraries
- Frontend: React, Angular, Vue, Svelte
- Backend: Express, Nest.js, Fastify
- Full-stack: Next.js, Nuxt.js, MERN/MEAN stacks
- Mobile: React Native, Ionic, Capacitor

### JavaScript Beyond the Web
- Desktop applications (Electron)
- Mobile applications (React Native, NativeScript)
- IoT and embedded systems
- Machine learning (TensorFlow.js)
- Game development

## 3. Setting Up a JavaScript Development Environment

### Code Editors
- **VS Code**: Free, feature-rich, extensive plugin ecosystem
- **Sublime Text**: Fast, lightweight, customizable
- **WebStorm**: Full-featured IDE specifically for JavaScript
- **Atom**: Customizable, GitHub integration
- Essential plugins: ESLint, Prettier, IntelliSense

### Browser Developer Tools
- Chrome DevTools / Firefox Developer Tools
- Elements/Inspector panel
- Console for JavaScript execution
- Network monitoring
- Performance profiling
- Application storage inspection

### Node.js and npm
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine
- **npm**: Node Package Manager
- Installation:
    - Windows/Mac: Download installer from nodejs.org
    - Linux: Use package manager
    - Version managers: nvm, n
- Verifying installation: `node -v` and `npm -v`

### Package Management Basics
- `package.json`: Project manifest
- `npm init`: Create new project
- `npm install`: Add dependencies
- `npm run`: Execute scripts
- Global vs. local installations
- yarn and pnpm as alternatives

### Version Control with Git and GitHub
- Basic Git commands: init, add, commit, push, pull
- GitHub for code hosting and collaboration
- Branching strategies
- Pull requests and code reviews
- GitHub Pages for hosting

### Online Development Environments
- **CodePen**: Quick frontend prototyping
- **JSFiddle**: Code sharing and collaboration
- **Replit**: Full development environment in browser
- **CodeSandbox**: Complex project development
- **StackBlitz**: VS Code in the browser
