# CSC 317 – Environment Setup Guide

## 1. Editors / IDEs
You’ll need a code editor to write and organize your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Any of the following work:

- **Visual Studio Code (recommended)**  
  Free, lightweight, and widely used. Extensions:  
  - *Live Server* – preview changes instantly in the browser  
  - *Prettier* – auto-format code  
  - *ESLint* – catch JavaScript errors  

- **WebStorm**  
  Paid IDE from JetBrains (free for students). Provides integrated Git, debugging, and intelligent autocomplete. Great if you prefer an all-in-one professional tool.

- **Neovim**  
  A terminal-based editor. Very customizable, powerful for advanced users. If you’re curious about Vim-style workflows, this can be a great learning experience, but it requires some configuration.

👉 Choose whichever editor you’re comfortable with — VS Code is the default for the course.

## 2. Browser
- **Google Chrome** (recommended for debugging with Chrome DevTools)  
- Firefox or Safari are fine, but most examples use Chrome.

---

## 3. Local Development Basics
- **Terminal**  
  - Navigate with `cd`, `ls`, `mkdir`, `rm`  
  - Run scripts with `node` and `npm`

- **Git & GitHub**  
  - Install Git, configure with your name and email  
  - Be able to clone repos, commit, push, and pull  
  - Create branches and open pull requests (via GitHub or GitHub Classroom)

- **Node.js + npm**  
  - Install the latest LTS version  
  - Verify with `node -v` and `npm -v`  
  - Install packages locally per project

---

## 4. HTML/CSS/JS Project Setup
A simple folder structure for your assignments:
```
project/
├── index.html
├── styles/
│   └── style.css
├── scripts/
│   └── script.js
└── images/
```
- Link CSS and JS correctly in `index.html`  
- :Run a live preview (VS Code Live Server, WebStorm’s built-in server, or `python -m http.server`)

## 5. Nice-to-Haves
- **Prettier** – auto-formats code  
- **ESLint** – linting for JavaScript  
- **Live Share (VS Code)** – real-time collaboration  
- **Markdown** – write clean README files

---

⚡️**Summary**: Students should be able to  
1. Write and edit code in their chosen editor (VS Code, WebStorm, or Neovim).  
2. Preview their work in the browser.  
3. Use GitHub for version control.  
4. Stay unblocked when working on assignments.
